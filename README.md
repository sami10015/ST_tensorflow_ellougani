# Special Topics: Deep Learning with TensorFlow

This course is an introduction to the major problems, techniques, and issues around deep learning. Emphasis is placed upon the topics of supervised and unsupervised learning for problem solving. This is a field rapidly growing in which we create deep learning models for computers to “know” how to make inferences, or make decisions, based on data all around us and even in its absence. The Tensorflow platform from Google will be used with its Python interface to illustrate various deep learning techniques.
